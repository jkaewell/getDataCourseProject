Codebook created by John Kaewell
March 22, 2015  

This codebook is based upon the Samsung database used for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.  The original test and
train datasets have been combined and sub-setted to only include the variables which include 'mean' or 'std' in
their names.  Subject and activity variables have been added to the merged, sub-setted data set.

The mean is computed on all of the variables for each subject and activity.

The original Samsung Dataset can be found at the following URL:
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
A full description of the dataset can be found at the following URL:
  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The set of variables in the dataset were created using the following function:

mean(): Mean value

The complete list of variables are listed below.  
The observations of each variable contain the mean of the original Samsung dataset
from the URL menitioned above, whereas the mean is based on grouping the original data 
according to each subject's activities
